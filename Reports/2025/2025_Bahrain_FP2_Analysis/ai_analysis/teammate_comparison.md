Okay, here's a deep teammate comparison report based on the provided FP2 data, covering cornering, braking, acceleration, and overall race pace for each target team:

### Red Bull Racing (VER vs TSU)

1.  **Cornering & Handling**:

    *   **Low Speed**: VER is faster (+0.000s vs +0.526s).
    *   **Mid Speed**: VER is faster (+0.099s vs +0.000s).
    *   **High Speed**: TSU is faster (+0.608s vs +0.381s).
    *   **Line Analysis**: VER demonstrates a consistent advantage through low and mid-speed corners, suggesting better rotation and possibly a "U-style" approach. TSU is faster in high-speed corners, suggesting a straighter line and confidence.
2.  **Brake & Straight**:

    *   **Braking**: Turn 1 deepest entry favors LEC (201.6 km/h), not directly applicable to VER/TSU but suggests overall braking limits being pushed. Turn 12 Deepest Entry, ANT favors (88.0km/h), no VER/TSU data available.
    *   **Acceleration**: Turn 1 best exit favors OCO (176.0 km/h) implying good power delivery. The "Acceleration & Brake Analysis" notes would give more specific insight to Red Bull, but is missing. VER's low and mid-speed advantages suggest strong throttle control to get the car rotated and accelerate effectively.
3.  **Verdict**:

    *   VER demonstrates superior one-lap pace through crucial low and medium-speed sections. He has a consistent advantage in most corner types.
    *   **Leader**: VER. He is consistently quicker across most corner types and is the benchmark.
