            <p>Okay, here's a deep teammate comparison report based on the provided FP2 data, covering cornering, braking, acceleration, and overall race pace for each target team:</p><p><h4>Red Bull Racing (VER vs TSU)</h4></p><p>1.  <strong>Cornering & Handling</strong>:</p><p>    *   <strong>Low Speed</strong>: VER is faster (+0.000s vs +0.526s).
    *   <strong>Mid Speed</strong>: VER is faster (+0.099s vs +0.000s).
    *   <strong>High Speed</strong>: TSU is faster (+0.608s vs +0.381s).
    *   <strong>Line Analysis</strong>: VER demonstrates a consistent advantage through low and mid-speed corners, suggesting better rotation and possibly a "U-style" approach. TSU is faster in high-speed corners, suggesting a straighter line and confidence.
2.  <strong>Brake & Straight</strong>:</p><p>    *   <strong>Braking</strong>: Turn 1 deepest entry favors LEC (201.6 km/h), not directly applicable to VER/TSU but suggests overall braking limits being pushed. Turn 12 Deepest Entry, ANT favors (88.0km/h), no VER/TSU data available.
    *   <strong>Acceleration</strong>: Turn 1 best exit favors OCO (176.0 km/h) implying good power delivery. The "Acceleration & Brake Analysis" notes would give more specific insight to Red Bull, but is missing. VER's low and mid-speed advantages suggest strong throttle control to get the car rotated and accelerate effectively.
3.  <strong>Verdict</strong>:</p><p>    *   VER demonstrates superior one-lap pace through crucial low and medium-speed sections. He has a consistent advantage in most corner types.
    *   <strong>Leader</strong>: VER. He is consistently quicker across most corner types and is the benchmark.</p><p><h4>Ferrari (LEC vs HAM)</h4></p><p>1.  <strong>Cornering & Handling</strong>:</p><p>    *   <strong>Low Speed</strong>: LEC is faster (+0.216s vs +0.381s).
    *   <strong>Mid Speed</strong>: LEC is faster (+0.098s vs +0.324s).
    *   <strong>High Speed</strong>: LEC is faster (+0.613s vs +0.819s).
    *   <strong>Line Analysis</strong>: LEC is consistently faster across all corner types, suggesting a better feel for the car.</p><p>2.  <strong>Brake & Straight</strong>:</p><p>    *   <strong>Braking</strong>: LEC pushed the entry limit at Turn 1 (201.6km/h).
    *   <strong>Acceleration</strong>: Best Exit at Turn 1 favors OCO (176.0 km/h). LEC's cornering advantage suggests effective braking to maximize corner entry speed while HAM potentially struggles to carry as much speed.
3.  <strong>Verdict</strong>:</p><p>    *   LEC shows a clear performance advantage, especially in the slow and medium-speed corners, indicating a superior car setup or driving style for this track.
    *   <strong>Leader</strong>: LEC. He is quicker in all corner segments.</p><p><h4>McLaren (NOR vs PIA)</h4></p><p>1.  <strong>Cornering & Handling</strong>:</p><p>    *   <strong>Low Speed</strong>: PIA is faster (+0.006s vs +0.173s).

    *   <strong>High Speed</strong>: STR is faster (+0.854s vs +0.054s).
    *   <strong>Line Analysis</strong>: ALO excels in low-speed corners, likely using a tighter line to maximize rotation. STR finds time in mid and high-speed corners.</p><p>2.  <strong>Brake & Straight</strong>:</p><p>    *   <strong>Braking</strong>: No specific braking data, but ALO's low-speed advantage suggests later braking and a more aggressive entry style.
    *   <strong>Acceleration</strong>: STR's high-speed advantage suggests better throttle control.</p><p>3.  <strong>Verdict</strong>:</p><p>    *   ALO shows strength in low-speed corners, indicating more aggressive entry and rotation. STR seems to manage high-speed sections better.
    *   <strong>Leader</strong>: STR seems to have better one lap-pace based on his Mid/High speed cornering performance.</p><p><h4>Alpine (GAS vs DOO)</h4></p><p>1.  <strong>Cornering & Handling</strong>:</p><p>    *   <strong>Low Speed</strong>: GAS is faster (+0.261s vs +0.440s).
    *   <strong>Mid Speed</strong>: GAS is faster (+0.239s vs +0.273s).
    *   <strong>High Speed</strong>: DOO is faster (+0.000s vs +0.574s).
    *   <strong>Line Analysis</strong>: GAS shows strength in low and mid-speed corners, while DOO excels at high speed.</p><p>2.  <strong>Brake & Straight</strong>:</p><p>    *   <strong>Braking</strong>: Based on DOO’s high-speed performance, he may have a more stable braking phase into fast corners.
    *   <strong>Acceleration</strong>: GAS's gains in low and medium speeds suggest better throttle response out of those corners.</p><p>3.  <strong>Verdict</strong>:</p><p>    *   GAS is generally faster, but DOO is quite competitive in high-speed corners. The Long Run data suggests both drivers are struggling with degradation, potentially negating any one-lap pace advantage.
    *   <strong>Leader</strong>: GAS. Overall advantage in most cornering conditions.</p><p><h4>Williams (ALB vs SAI)</h4></p><p>1.  <strong>Cornering & Handling</strong>:</p><p>    *   <strong>Low Speed</strong>: ALB is faster (+0.300s vs +0.140s).
