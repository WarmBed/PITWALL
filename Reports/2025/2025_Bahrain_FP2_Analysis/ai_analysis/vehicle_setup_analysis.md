### 🔧 Vehicle Setup & Performance Summary (Most vs Least Competitive)

**Most Competitive Setup:** VER and DOO appear to have the most competitive setups overall. VER consistently sets competitive times across all corner types, demonstrating a well-balanced setup. DOO shines particularly in high-speed corners, indicated by being the "Corner Master" for Turn 12 and having a +0.000s Time Loss. The team with HAD showed the best performance during the long run race sims on the medium tyres with an average of 99.636s, suggesting a setup that is kind on the tyres and good over a stint, despite the degradation issues noted.

**Least Competitive Setup:** BOR is struggling significantly. They are identified as the "Biggest Loser" in both Turn 4 and Turn 12. In the High Speed corner analysis, BOR showed +1.215s time loss, indicating a significant lack of grip or poor balance. This coupled with the long-run data showing high degradation implies that the car is using the tyres too aggressively, likely due to an unstable platform or too much sliding.

**Setup Philosophy Analysis:** The data suggests that a balance between apex speed and straight-line speed is crucial. ANT demonstrated high apex speeds in Turn 1 and Turn 12, suggesting a high downforce setup. However, their overall lap time might be compromised by lower straight-line speed. Conversely, other drivers sacrifice mid-corner speed to optimize power delivery and exit speed, as shown by OCO and PIA in Turn 1 and Turn 12 respectively. A high downforce setup will deliver high apex speed but may lack overall pace, whereas low drag will have low apex speed but more straight line speed.

### 🛑 Acceleration & Brake Deep Dive

**Brake Master:** LEC exhibits the highest entry speed into the low-speed Turn 1 (201.6 km/h), indicating high braking confidence and the ability to carry a lot of speed into the corner. ANT also demonstrates strong braking performance with the highest entry speed into Turn 12 (88.0 km/h), further highlighting this ability.

Braking stability is crucial for good exit traction. Drivers like VER and ALO, who show relatively less time loss in corners, likely have a more stable car under braking, allowing them to get on the power earlier and maintain good exit speed. The data also implies that cars that can maintain higher apex speed are able to accelerate sooner out of the corner.

### 🏎️ Technical Deep Dive: Race Simulations

The "Team Performance Battle" clearly indicates that the Medium compound is the preferred race tyre. The Hard compound, being approximately -1.884s slower, is only viable if Medium compound degradation is unmanageable. HAD shows the best performance on the Mediums overall. However, HAD, BOR, and DOO are flagged for high thermal degradation.

### 💡 Weekend Setup Recommendations

Struggling teams, particularly BOR, should focus on improving car stability under braking and reducing tyre degradation. Based on VER's setup, increasing front wing angle and/or softening the front suspension could improve turn-in response and reduce reliance on the rear tyres. Improving mechanical grip through suspension adjustments and potentially slightly higher ride height could also mitigate the sliding and reduce tyre overheating. The goal is to shift the balance towards a more predictable and stable car, allowing the driver to carry more speed into the corners and maintain tyre life over longer stints.
